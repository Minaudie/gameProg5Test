Game prog 5 Assign 2

Build an action system that can do and undo actions made by either the player or the computer for use in a turn based game. The action class itself should be virtual and your action system shouldn't care about specifics. Code up a test suite to prove that your solution works. 

PDF with this information: functionPointersMultithreading

std::function<void(int)> someName = some method that matches void(int)

void print(int){} //defined elsewhere

Like function pointers but they have a feature called **bind**
Bind lets you inject the values into the function you are calling.

take a vector array

Vector<std::function> v

add the reverse command to your vector
v.push_back(bind(//reverse of what user did))

when they want to undo
std::function haha = v.pop_back();

get the most recent reverse action
haha();

then run.
